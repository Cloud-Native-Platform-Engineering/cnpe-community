## Introduction

Part of what makes the CNCF so amazing is the diversity of people involved and supported by the community. One way we make this community more inclusive is by providing localizations for content where possible. Localizations of course require native speakers to create and maintain them and this post is about how you can do that within the TAG App Delivery content.
