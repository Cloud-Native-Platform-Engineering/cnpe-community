## Initiatives and Projects

As Platform Engineering practices evolve rapidly, the CNPE Community is committed to fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing. We have several active initiatives and projects that are ready for contribution and participation. These initiatives focus on various aspects of platform engineering, from product thinking to maturity assessments.

For information on initiatives, or to propose a new initiative, please see the [Initiatives and Projects](/initiatives/) page.
