## Introduction

(Add link to initiatives and projects page)
## Localization

Part of what makes the CNCF so amazing is the diversity of people involved and supported by the community. One way we make this community more inclusive is by providing localizations for content where possible. Localizations of course require native speakers to create and maintain them and this post is about how you can do that within the CNPE Community content.

The Platform Engineering artifacts and website are initially developed in English, but we welcome contributions to localize them into other languages. This is a great way to help make the content accessible to a wider audience and to contribute to the community.

## Initiatives and Projects

As Platform Engineering practices evolve rapidly, the CNPE Community is committed to fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing. We have several active initiatives and projects that are ready for contribution and participation. These initiatives focus on various aspects of platform engineering, from product thinking to maturity assessments.

For information on initiatives, or to propose a new initiative, please see the [Initiatives and Projects](/initiatives/) page.
