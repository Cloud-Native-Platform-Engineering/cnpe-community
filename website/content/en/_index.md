The Cloud Native Platform Engineering Working Group Community is a community of practitioners, vendors, and end-users who are interested in the practice of building and operating cloud native platforms. The community is focused on sharing knowledge, best practices, and tools to help organizations build and operate cloud native platforms effectively.

The community is open to anyone who is interested in cloud native platform engineering, regardless of their level of experience or expertise. The community is a place for practitioners to share their experiences, ask questions, and learn from each other.

<!-- For more information, see [About](./about/) -->

## Scope

This community is primarily focused on Cloud Native Platform Engineering and support of the practice within the CNCF ecosystem. The community is not focused on any specific technology or vendor, but rather on the practice of building and operating cloud native platforms.

Our members represent many diverse roles and personas, including:

- Platform consumers / end-users
- Platform developers, maintainers, and providers
- Internal service providers
- Project maintainers and contributors
- Specialists in other areas such as security, networking, storage, etc. who are interested in how their work fits into the platform engineering practice

For examples of Platform Personas see: [Platform as a Product: Understanding the Personas](https://www.cloudnativeplatforms.com/blog/paap-personas/)
