# Platform as a Product Overview

Platform as a Product is a critical topic in the industry because it helps teams to work agile in our forever changing organizations and market. Platform as a Product is key to helping us move quickly and be ready for new technology in a standardized way. According to the [CNCF Platforms White Paper] (https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/), Platform as a product is defined as:

Platform as a product: A platform exists to serve the requirements of its users and it should be designed and evolved based on those requirements, similar to any other software products. Platforms should provide the necessary capabilities to support the most common use cases across product teams and prioritize those over more specific capabilities that are only used by a single team to maximize the value delivered.


# Understanding the personas

When considering its users, we need to identify the different personas such as: Developers, ML Engineers, Data Scientists, Platform Engineers, and others.

The personas would focus on different aspects of the platform:


* Platform Builders (focus on platform and beneficiary experience):

** Enabling Day2 Platform Operations
** Setting up the platform
** Setting up security
** Platform Capabilities for AI
** Platform capabilities for HPC workloads

* Platform Enablers (focus on end-users and application capabilities):

** Enabling cloud-native and legacy workloads with best practices such as CI/CD and security guardrails.
** Enabling user experience and self-service capabilities
** Build automation practices to simplify onboarding experiences for end users.
** Configuration integrations and third-party tools

* Platform Consumers - Platform Customers (Developers):

** Access the platform to maintain and build applications
** Build any applications from legacy systems, cloud-native, AI
** Might not interact with the platform directly.

* Platform End-Users (customers):

** Customers who are the end-users of the applications and systems running on top of the platform.
** Might not interact with the platform directly.

* Service Providers:
** Organizations who are experts in building platforms and providing Platforms on top of Kubernetes.
** Consulting organizations that help teams drive implementations and adoption around the platform
