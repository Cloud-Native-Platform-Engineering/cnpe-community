KubeCon NA 2024 is almost here!  
The TAG App Delivery is excited to bring together cloud-native application developers
and framework builders to meet each other and share insights and knowledge.
Our goal is to make cloud development better for all by gathering feedback,
finding synergies and guiding both users and projects.

## TAG booth

You can find the TAG App Delivery at our booth **Kiosk 4A** in the project pavilion,
where we will have lightning talks and showcase the work of the platforms and artifact working groups.

If you would like to submit a Lightning Talk, please use this form: [Lightning Talk Submission Form](https://forms.gle/Bd1niXk9kxnctxtBA)

Please note the following requirements to submit a talk propsal
- The topic should be relevant to the TAG app-delivery. If in doubt, refer to [our charter](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/)
- When submitting project presentations, keep in mind that we will only accept CNCF projects, or projects submitted to CNCF sandbox.
