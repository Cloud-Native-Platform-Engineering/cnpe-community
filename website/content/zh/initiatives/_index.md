## Active Initiatives and Projects

### Content Club

Website: [Content Club](https://cloudnativeplatforms.com/initiatives/content-club/)

#### Overview

The Content Club is a community-driven initiative aimed at fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among platform engineering enthusiasts. It provides a space for members to discuss, create, and share content related to platform engineering practices, tools, and technologies.

#### Schedule

Each month, a topic is selected for discussion and content creation. Members are encouraged to contribute articles, blog posts, videos, or other forms of content related to the topic.

Previous topics have included:

- February 2025 - Team Topologies in the Real World
- March 2025 - Metrics That Matter
- April 2025 - How can AI help your platform engineers?
- May 2025 - What Happens When Platforms Become Mature
- June 2025 - “non-technical” Platform Engineering
- July 2025 - Platform Engineering for Edge Computing

See the [Content Club](/initiatives/content-club/) page for more details on the current topic and how to participate.

### Platform as a Product

Website: [Platform as a Product](https://cloudnativeplatforms.com/initiatives/platform-as-a-product/)

#### Overview

The **Platform as a Product (PaaP) Initiative** is dedicated to advancing Product Thinking in platform engineering. Our mission is to help platform teams treat their internal platforms as products and their users as customers, ensuring platforms deliver real value and meet user needs.

#### Schedule

This effort is ongoing, with regular updates and contributions from the community. We are actively evaluating creation of scoped initiatives for specific work streams.

#### Deliverables

- Platform as a Product Research
- Platform as a Product Whitepaper
- [Featured Blog Posts](/initiatives/platform-as-a-product/#featured-blog-posts)

### Platform Maturity Model Assessment

Website: [Platform Maturity Model Assessment](/initiatives/platform-maturity-model-assessment/)

#### Overview

The Platform Maturity Assessment is an accompanying tool to the Platform Maturity Model that simplifies the experience for End Users to identify where their organization sits on the maturity curve. The Assessment will provide a simple and short survey to identify the maturity level according to the categories in the Maturity Model. Organizations can use the Maturity Model to discover the definitions and characteristics at each level of maturity and as a source for guidance on improving their capabilities.

#### Schedule

- User Acceptance/Beta Testing : 2025-06-24 - 2025-08-05
- Beta : 2025-08-05 - 2025-10-31
- GA Launch : 2025-11-10 (Kubecon Atlanta)

#### Deliverables

- Platform Maturity Assessment

## Related CNCF Project and Initiatives

There are many initiatives, projects, and working groups that are related to Platform Engineering across the Cloud Native and CNCF ecosystems. Just as Platform Engineers connect specialization across many domains, we are committed to collaborating with these groups to ensure that our community members are aware of the broader landscape and can actively contribute to discussions and initiatives. Doing so helps to ensure that the Platform Engineering community is well-informed and can more effectively support the healthy development of the Cloud Native ecosystem.

Initiatives that are housed under other TAGs but are important to Platform Engineering.

[CNCF Cartografos Working Group](https://community.cncf.io/cncf-cartografos-working-group/) is a community-driven project that aims to create a comprehensive map of the cloud native ecosystem, including projects, tools, and technologies. It provides a visual representation of the relationships between different components in the cloud native landscape.

## Former Initiatives and Projects

[CNCF TAG App Delivery](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/) is the former home of the Cloud Native Platform Engineering Working Group Community. It was focused on application delivery practices and tools within the CNCF ecosystem.

[Platform Whitepaper](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/) is a comprehensive document that outlines the principles, practices, and tools for building and operating cloud native platforms. It serves as a foundational resource for understanding platform engineering in the context of cloud native technologies.

[Platform Maturity Model](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platform-eng-maturity-model/) is a framework for assessing the maturity of cloud native platforms. It provides a set of criteria and best practices for organizations to evaluate their platform capabilities and identify areas for improvement.

[Glossary](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/wgs/platforms/glossary/) is a living document that defines key terms and concepts related to platform engineering. It aims to create a common language for practitioners and facilitate better communication within the community.
