# Platforms white paper

Formerly known as the Platforms Working Group under CNCF TAG App Delivery, the Cloud Native Platform Engineering Community maintains and publishes this paper describing platforms
for cloud-native computing to support project maintainers and cloud users in
planning and designing such platforms.

v1 was completed in March 2023; improvements and iterations continue in the
[`latest`](./latest/) directory.

Currently, the edition in the `latest` directory is published to The Cloud Native Platform Engineering Community's website at [https://cloudnativeplatforms.com/whitepapers/platforms](https://cloudnativeplatforms.com/whitepapers/platforms).

## Modifying diagrams

To modify the platforms-def diagram, download [the latest
version](./latest/assets/platforms-def.drawio.png) and open it in
<https://draw.io/>. When you're done with edits, choose File > Export As >
PNG... and be sure to click "Include a copy of my diagram" as shown in the
following graphic. Then find the downloaded image and include it in a PR.

Please save and replace the XML version here as well for completeness. To do so,
in draw.io again choose File > Export As > XML... Find the downloaded file and
replace `./latest/assets/platforms-def.drawio.xml` with it for your PR.
