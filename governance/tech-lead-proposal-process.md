# TAG App Delivery Technical Lead Proposal Process

App Delivery Technical Leads operate as a team alongside the Co-Chairs. The Co-Chair
team seeks enhance the leadership capabilities of the existing co-chairs across
the key qualities of industry experience, hands-on cloud-native and security
experience, as well as administrative experience needed to assist in the
execution of the various projects and efforts that make the TAG App Delivery so
successful.

## Caveats of Technical Leads

* The position of a technical lead does not guarantee future co-chair nomination
* The position of a technical lead is not a paid position (co-chairs are also
  not paid positions)
* Technical leads [have responsibilities](roles.md) to the App Delivery TAG, the
  leadership team, and the TOC
* Nominations still
  [require TOC
  approval](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections)

## Process of nominations

Depending on the needs of the community, as determined by the App Delivery TAG
leadership team, technical lead nominations may come in the form of "Nominees by co-chairs" at the moment.

The App Delivery TAG does not have a current limit on the amount of technical leads.

Final technical lead nominations will adhere to the [CNCF's TOC described
process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections).

### Nominees by co-chairs

Nominees by co-chairs adhere to the technical lead requirements described below.
Co-chairs are responsible for documenting statistic information of all nominee
types for endorsement and presentation to the TOC.

with the group and are actively contributing in a meaningful way, the following
