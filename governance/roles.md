One of the TAG chairs serves as the working group sponsor and provides guidance to the working group leads.
Working group leads are signed off by the TAG Chairs and the TOC Liaisons.

## TOC Liaison

The [CNCF TAG](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/tags) process identifies a TOC Liaison.
The TAG Chairs are responsible for establishing effective communication with the TOC Liaison, including further communication to the wider TOC upon request.

The TOC Liaison will occasionally prioritize TAG activities, as needed by the TOC, to further the [CNCF mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation).

## Emeritus Chair

After a TAG Chair completes their term, they transition into the role of Emeritus Chair.
This role does not impose any obligations on the TAG, but it acknowledges their committed time and effort.
The role also lets them share information about their previous work and contributions to the TAG.
An Emeritus Chair retains the same rights/access as in their previous role.
